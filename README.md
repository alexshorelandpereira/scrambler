# Scrambler
A C++ project designed to read in a text file, encrypt the data using various ciphers, output an encrypted text file and be able to decrypt it again.
The end goal will be to be able to use different ciphers through a CLI. This Project's purpose is to develop my understanding of C++.
The folder src contains the .cpp and .h files that make up the system.
The 'tests' folder contains the tests that I used on the system. If, for whatever reason you want to run these tests, you'll need 
to download and integrate google test for yourself.
